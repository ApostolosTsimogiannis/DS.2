# DS.2 RC Helicopter Build Manual

## Introduction:

The DS.2 is the second helicopter of the DS.Z RC Heli Project. The helicopter was designed with the flowing goals:
Make a fully 3D capable RC helicopter.
The helicopter must be in the 550 to 600 class.
Be as light as possible.
Use the minimum number of metallic parts.
Be 3D printable.
Use as many parts as possible that are available ion the market (not helicopter specific).
Be able to use parts from multiple other helicopter brands where needed (metallic parts).

These would make the helicopter essentially an ‘open source’ type of project since builders can make the parts locally and cheaply. The very low count of metallic parts guarantees that this helicopter will never run out of spares either!

The design settled to a 570 size and was completed in 2024. It has flown very well and has proven reliable and robust in moderate 3D flight, including a few crashes!
A few parts underwent small modifications and this is the final version (v2.1) of the helicopter. 

Since each build will be unique, each builder must treat this as a semi-prototype helicopter.

Enjoy the build!
