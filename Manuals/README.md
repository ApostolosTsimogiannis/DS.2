# DS.2 RC Helicopter Build Manual

## Introduction:

The DS.2 is the second helicopter of the DS.Z RC Heli Project. The helicopter was designed with the flowing goals: 
- Make a fully 3D capable RC helicopter.
- The helicopter must be in the 550 to 600 class.
- Be as light as possible.
- Use the minimum number of metallic parts.
- Be 3D printable.
- Use as many parts as possible that are available ion the market (not helicopter specific).
- Be able to use parts from multiple other helicopter brands where needed (metallic parts).

These would make the helicopter essentially an ‘open source’ type of project since builders can make the parts locally and cheaply. The very low count of metallic parts guarantees that this helicopter will never run out of spares either!

The design started in December 2023 and settled to a 570 size and was completed in 2024. It has flown very well and has proven reliable and robust in moderate 3D flight, including a few crashes!
A few parts underwent small modifications and this is the final version (v2.1) of the helicopter. 

Since each build will be unique, each builder must treat this as a semi-prototype helicopter.

Enjoy the build!

## General information about the build:

The DS.2 is a RC helicopter intended for hobbyists with advanced knowledge of assembling helicopters and tool skills to build or adapt parts. This manual is not a exhaustive presentation of the build process and good assembly practices and knowledge of RC helicopter assembly are prerequisites for this build.

The builder must be capable and have the tools to:

- Drill precision holes in hardened shafts.
- Cut hardened shafts.
- Use drills or other tools to drill or clean holes and bearing seats.


The model is built using the following materials:
- Carbon sheet
- MJF (MultiJet Fusion) 3D printed parts
- FDM 3D printed parts
- Existing parts of commercially available RC helicopters
- Bearings, screws, belts widely available in the market.

The usual materials and tools are required:
- Thread lock
- Epoxy glue
- Lubricating oil
- Soldering iron
- Hex, torx and other drivers, depending on the screws used.

Many of the parts needed are common among various RC helicotpter models available in the market such as Mikado Logo 600 series, Goosky RS5 or RS6, Align etc. so parts from those helis may be available to the builder from other projects.
All parts, except from the shafts (main, spindle, 1st Stage, tail, tail spindle) can be found in the market. It is recommended the shafts are bought from existing models unless the builder has access to machining and case hardening.

Use thread locking compound in all metal to metal contacts except is a retainer nut is used.

For metal thread screws into MJF plastics thread locker is not needed but the thread forming must not go through the entire thread depth. Allow some section for the screw to cut its own thread and ‘lock’ with the mating piece. These screws will not come off. Be careful of how much you tighten such screws. They must not be tightened like in metal.
Regardless of where a bolt threads into, remember you are tightening M2, M2.5, M3 screws. Do not treat them like M30!

All metal thread bolts used must be high strength.

When using screws specifically made for plastic, no thread tool is needed. The screw will form its own thread and can be tightened more than metal screws in plastic. These screws are not very good at being removable and over-tightening them will reduce further the number of times they can be loosened and tightened.

All bearing seats must be cleaned with a tool that has a square edge. Some screwdrivers will do or square tip exacto knives. The seat must be cleaned form the nylon powder and the edges pressed. This will make the bearing seat better. All nylon parts have a small surface roughness which allows for some give, so bearings fit with a moderate transition fit, perfect for the use.

MJF 3D printed parts are only accurate to more than 0.1mm which is not machining accuracy, therefore some part assembly may require part cleaning. The work on the pieces should not require material removal and parts should fit as expected. If this is not the case then discuss with your MJF parts manufacturer.

It is recommended that SLS is not used as a process. Depending on the implementation parts may be more brittle that expected. Discuss with your 3D print shop and maybe test one or two pieces for flexibility.

## Making the Main and Stage 1 Shafts:
<details> 
<summary> Open Chapter </summary>

The main shaft can be manufactured from different shafts in the market. Mikado 199mm shaft is convenient as it has the top hole at the right position. The 1st stage shaft can be made from any 10mm shaft on the market. <br>
Since the shafts are hardened, it is recommended that the position of the drilling is lightly flattened with a Dremel disk so the case hardening is removed and it becomes easier to drill. Use a low speed drill. <br>
Some dimensions do not need to be exactly as shown below. Shaft length can be up to +2mm. Hole positioning can be within 1mm or more of the shown dimension, but consider the following:The relative distance between the too holes on the Stagge 1 shaft needs to be accurate for parts to fit, and for links to have the dimensions shown in this manual, the relative distance between the two holes on the main shaft needs to be accurate.

## Stage 1 Shaft Assembly:
<details> 
<summary> Open Chapter </summary>

### Preparation:
Use a 10mm diameter drill bit to clean out the shaft hole of the printed pulleys. Do not use a normal high speed drill. If you do not have a low speed drill press, use a choke and drill bit, and drive it through by hand, turning as you go. Go back and forth s few times to clean out any surface debris form the printing process.
Use the 2nd M3 thread tool to tap the smaller diameter hole side. This is were the positioning bolt will thread into. <br>
Assemble as shown below.

## Main Shaft and Stage 2 Assembly:
<details> 
<summary> Open Chapter </summary>

### Preparation:
Clean all surfaces and the 10mm shaft hole of the tail pulley as in the previous section. <br><br>
Assemble as shown below.<br>
Use 2x0.5mm washers between the OWB and the tail pulley.<br>
For a Mikado OWB hub (shown below) use 5x0.5mm washers below the OWB.<br>
Use 1x0.5mm washer above the tail pulley.<br>

## Lower Plate Assembly:
<details> 
<summary> Open Chapter </summary>

### Preparation:
Clean all surfaces of the 3D printed parts with a small screwdriver. Make sure there is no nylon powder residue on the surface. You can use air gun if you have one.<br>
Prepare a small amount of two-part epoxy. <br> <br>
Use epoxy at all areas marked with the orange arrow in the drawing. Make sure you do not use too much and it overspills. Especially the bearings need a small amount only, to function as a retainer. CA glue can also be used for the bearings. Press the 3D printed parts onto the carbon plate so they are flush with the edges and do not protrude. This is important for the fit in the assembled frame later.<br>
The 4 screws are plastic-specific screws 2.9x6mm. If you cannot find self tapping flat tip ones, and you use pointed screws it’s suggested you cut the tip and do not allow it to protrude.

## Main Grip Assembly:
<details> 
<summary> Open Chapter </summary>

### Preparation:

Clean the bearings seats inside the grip with a small screwdriver and a square tip tool. Make sure there is no nylon powder residue on the surface and especially in the bearing seat.
Tap the grip arm ball link bolt hole with M3 tap tool. Do not bottom out the tool. Clean the four M3 holes and make sure the M3x30 bolts go through.
<br>
<br>
Per grip you will need:<br>
1x M3x16<br>
1x M3 washer<br>
4x M3x30<br>
4x M3 lock nuts<br>
1x M4x35<br>
1x M4 lock  nut <br>
2x 8x16x5 bearings<br>
1x 8x16x5 thrust bearing<br>
1x Ø10 washer (0.5, 0.2, 0.1 as needed)<br>
1x 8x0.5 washer<br>
<br>
Grease the thrust bearing as needed and position it with the small diameter to the outside.
<br>

Use the inner Ø10 washers as needed to allow
minimal play of each grip when assembled (~0.2mm total gap).

The Ø8 washer must only contact the inner race of the outer bearing.

You can leave the ball link for later, as you need to add the grip arm link
before you insert the bolt into the grip (highlighted on the drawing).
The grip arm ball link can be from any helicopter as long as it fits an M3 bolt.
Mikado grip-arm ball links work well.

## Head Assembly:
<details> 
<summary> Open Chapter </summary>

## Damped Head:<br>

### Preparation:<br>

Clean all 3D printed parts of any nylon powder residue on the surface and especially in the damper seat.<br>
Make sure all M3 bolts can pass through the main head block.<br>

Per grip you will need:<br>
6x M3x25<br>
6x M3 lock nuts<br>

Assemble the main head block withe the dampers and the spindle first.<br>
The M3 bolts will pass through by lightly threading them (they will cut a thread
into the damper).
