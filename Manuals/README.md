# DS.2 RC Helicopter Build Manual:

## Introduction:

The DS.2 is the second helicopter of the DS.Z RC Heli Project. The helicopter was designed with the flowing goals:
Make a fully 3D capable RC helicopter.
The helicopter must be in the 550 to 600 class.
Be as light as possible.
Use the minimum number of metallic parts.
Be 3D printable.
Use as many parts as possible that are available ion the market (not helicopter specific).
Be able to use parts from multiple other helicopter brands where needed (metallic parts).

These would make the helicopter essentially an ‘open source’ type of project since builders can make the parts locally and cheaply. The very low count of metallic parts guarantees that this helicopter will never run out of spares either!

The design settled to a 570 size and was completed in 2024. It has flown very well and has proven reliable and robust in moderate 3D flight, including a few crashes!
A few parts underwent small modifications and this is the final version (v2.1) of the helicopter. 

Since each build will be unique, each builder must treat this as a semi-prototype helicopter.

Enjoy the build!

## General information about the build:

The DS.2 is a RC helicopter intended for hobbyists with advanced knowledge of assembling helicopters and tool skills to build or adapt parts. 

The builder must be capable and have the tools to:
  Drill precision holes in hardened shafts.
  Cut hardened shafts.
  Use drills or other tools to drill or clean holes and bearing seats.

The model is built using the following materials:
  Carbon sheet
  MJF (MultiJet Fusion) 3D printed parts
  FDM 3D printed parts
  Existing parts of commercially available RC helicopters
  Bearings, screws, belts widely available in the market.

The usual materials and tools are required:
  Thread lock
  Epoxy glue
  Lubricating oil
  Soldering iron
  Hex, torx and other drivers, depending on the screws used.

Many of the parts needed are common among various RC helicotpter models available in the market such as Mikado Logo 600 series, Goosky RS5 or RS6, Align etc. so parts fro mthose helis may be available to the builder from other projects.
All parts, except from the shafts (main, spindle, 1st Stage, tail, tail spindle) can be found in the market. It is recommended the shafts are bought from existing models unless the builder has access to machining and case hardening.
