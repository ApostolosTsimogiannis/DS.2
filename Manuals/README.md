# DS.2 RC Helicopter Build Manual

## Introduction:

The DS.2 is the second helicopter of the DS.Z RC Heli Project. The helicopter was designed with the flowing goals: 
- Make a fully 3D capable RC helicopter.
- The helicopter must be in the 550 to 600 class.
- Be as light as possible.
- Use the minimum number of metallic parts.
- Be 3D printable.
- Use as many parts as possible that are available ion the market (not helicopter specific).
- Be able to use parts from multiple other helicopter brands where needed (metallic parts).

These would make the helicopter essentially an ‘open source’ type of project since builders can make the parts locally and cheaply. The very low count of metallic parts guarantees that this helicopter will never run out of spares either!

The design started in December 2023 and settled to a 570 size and was completed in 2024. It has flown very well and has proven reliable and robust in moderate 3D flight, including a few crashes!
A few parts underwent small modifications and this is the final version (v2.1) of the helicopter. 

Since each build will be unique, each builder must treat this as a semi-prototype helicopter.

Enjoy the build!

## General information about the build:

The DS.2 is a RC helicopter intended for hobbyists with advanced knowledge of assembling helicopters and tool skills to build or adapt parts. 

The builder must be capable and have the tools to:

- Drill precision holes in hardened shafts.
- Cut hardened shafts.
- Use drills or other tools to drill or clean holes and bearing seats.


The model is built using the following materials:
- Carbon sheet
- MJF (MultiJet Fusion) 3D printed parts
- FDM 3D printed parts
- Existing parts of commercially available RC helicopters
- Bearings, screws, belts widely available in the market.

The usual materials and tools are required:
- Thread lock
- Epoxy glue
- Lubricating oil
- Soldering iron
- Hex, torx and other drivers, depending on the screws used.

Many of the parts needed are common among various RC helicotpter models available in the market such as Mikado Logo 600 series, Goosky RS5 or RS6, Align etc. so parts from those helis may be available to the builder from other projects.
All parts, except from the shafts (main, spindle, 1st Stage, tail, tail spindle) can be found in the market. It is recommended the shafts are bought from existing models unless the builder has access to machining and case hardening.

Use thread locking compound in all metal to metal contacts except is a retainer nut is used.

For metal thread screws into MJF plastics thread locker is not needed but the thread forming must not go through the entire thread depth. Allow some section for the screw to cut its own thread and ‘lock’ with the mating piece. These screws will not come off. Be careful of how much you tighten such screws. They must not be tightened like in metal.
Regardless of where a bolt threads into, remember you are tightening M2, M2.5, M3 screws. Do not treat them like M30!

All metal thread bolts used must be high strength.

When using screws specifically made for plastic, no thread tool is needed. The screw will form its own thread and can be tightened more than metal screws in plastic. These screws are not very good at being removable and over-tightening them will reduce further the number of times they can be loosened and tightened.

All bearing seats must be cleaned with a tool that has a square edge. Some screwdrivers will do or square tip exacto knives. The seat must be cleaned form the nylon powder and the edges pressed. This will make the bearing seat better. All nylon parts have a small surface roughness which allows for some give, so bearings fit with a moderate transition fit, perfect for the use.

MJF 3D printed parts are only accurate to more than 0.1mm which is not machining accuracy, therefore some part assembly may require part cleaning. The work on the pieces should not require material removal and parts should fit as expected. If this is not the case then discuss with your MJF parts manufacturer.

It is recommended that SLS is not used as a process. Depending on the implementation parts may be more brittle that expected. Discuss with your 3D print shop and maybe test one or two pieces for flexibility.
